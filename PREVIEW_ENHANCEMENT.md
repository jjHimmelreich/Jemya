# Preview Table Enhancement Summary

## ✅ **COMPLETED**: Enhanced Preview Table to Show All AI Recommendations

### **What Was Changed**

**Problem**: The preview table only showed tracks that were found on Spotify (17-18 tracks), but didn't show the tracks that the AI recommended but couldn't be found.

**Solution**: Modified the preview table to show **all 28 AI-recommended tracks** with their status.

### **Key Improvements**

1. **📊 Complete Track List**
   - Shows all AI recommendations in original order
   - Includes both found and not-found tracks
   - Maintains the AI's intended playlist flow

2. **🎯 Status Column Added**
   - ✅ Found: Track found on Spotify with clickable link
   - ❌ Not Found: AI recommendation that couldn't be found

3. **📝 Enhanced Table Headers**
   - Added "Status" column
   - Updated track count to show total AI recommendations
   - Shows breakdown: "28 AI recommendations (17 found, 11 not found)"

4. **🔗 Smart Linking**
   - Found tracks: Clickable links to Spotify
   - Not-found tracks: Plain text (no links)
   - Duration and timing only for found tracks

### **Technical Changes**

**Modified Files:**
- `app.py`: Enhanced preview table generation

**Key Code Changes:**
1. **Preview Data Structure**: Added `original_suggestions` to preview data
2. **Table Generation**: Show all AI tracks in recommended order
3. **Status Tracking**: Visual indicators for found vs not-found tracks
4. **Matching Logic**: Smart matching between AI suggestions and found tracks

### **New Preview Table Format**

```
| # | Track | Artist | Album | Duration | Start Time | Status |
